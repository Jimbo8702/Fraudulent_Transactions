# Fraudulent_Transactions

Using data provided via a CSV file with examples of fraudulent transactions, I built a machine learning model to predict whether a transcation will be flagged as fraudulent or not. The type of machine learning model is a Neural Network built with keras and tensorflow.

# Model Results

Accuracy: 0.9988800287246704
Loss: 0.004991254769265652

The Accuracy shown is 99%. This is just a simple version of a fraud detection model. A real model would consist of a larger dataset with more layers to aviod overfitting and give enough of each example outcome.
